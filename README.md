# Keyboard Text Editor 
Converts Mac preinstalled keyboard text from one language to another.
This program was thought up due to longstanding frustration working as a linguist and language learner, constantly switching between multiple Mac keyboards for my work. Inevitably, I would begin to type a sentence or two, perhaps even more, and notice that I had not switched back into the language in which I was trying to type. For example, if I were to type "he runs fast" in English, but was still working in the Russian phonetic keyboard, I would have just typed nonsense Cyrillic letters that correspond to the keystrokes I hit (ie. 'че рунс фаст'). 

Rather than erasing the entirety of the text and retyping the text after converting into the desired keyboard, it seemed far more expedient to write a few lines of Python code that could do this automatically, and to save that program as a shortcut locally on my computer.
